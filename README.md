# sorting-techniques
Sorting is one of the most fundamental algorithmic problems within computer science. It has been claimed that as many as 25% of all CPU cycles are spent sorting, which provides a lot of incentive for further study and optimization of sorting. In addition, there are many other tasks (searching, calculating the median, finding the mode, removing duplicates, etc.) that can be implemented much more efficiently once the data is sorted. The wide variety of algorithms gives us a lot of richness to explore, especially when considering the tradeoffs offered in terms of efficiency, operation mix, code complexity, best/worst case inputs, and so on.
